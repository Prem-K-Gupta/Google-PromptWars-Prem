# VOID CADET: The Infinite Arcade (2026 Edition)

**Project Vertical:** Next-Generation Entertainment / Generative Roguelite  
**Engine:** React 18, React Three Fiber (Three.js), Cannon.js (Physics)  
**Intelligence:** Google Gemini Multimodal Suite (3 Pro, 2.5 Flash, Veo, Image, Live API)

## 🌌 The Vision: Pinball Reimagined
VOID CADET is not just a pinball table; it is a procedurally generated cosmic odyssey. By moving beyond the static limitations of 90s arcade machines, we have created an environment where the universe itself adapts to the player's skill, pace, and curiosity. 

Inspired by the depth of *Balatro* and the infinite scale of *No Man's Sky*, VOID CADET utilizes the **Google Gemini API** as a "Live Game Master" that hallucinates new biomes, physics constants, and narrative arcs in real-time.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### 1. The Procedural Physics Engine
Unlike traditional games with baked levels, VOID CADET uses a **Dynamic Config Injection** system. 
- **Core**: A high-performance WebGL scene using `react-three/fiber`.
- **The Brain**: When a "Warp" is triggered, Gemini generates a `Planet` schema.
- **Hot-Swapping**: The physics engine (`@react-three/cannon`) immediately updates the gravity vector, floor friction, and material restitution based on the AI's hallucination (e.g., an "Ice Planet" results in `friction: 0.01` and `gravity: -5`).

### 2. Multimodal AI Orchestration
We utilize the full spectrum of the Gemini ecosystem to ensure every sense is engaged:
- **Vision (Veo 3.1)**: Procedural cinematic "Warp Sequences" are generated via `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`. These are not pre-rendered videos but 720p 16:9 MP4s created on-demand based on the destination planet's name.
- **Voice (Live API)**: The "Bridge Tactician" utilizes the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio** model. It processes raw PCM audio streams from the player's microphone to provide real-time, low-latency tactical coaching.
- **Narrative (Gemini 3 Pro)**: High-budget "Thinking" tokens (16,000 budget) analyze game logs upon failure to provide a grounded, character-driven debriefing that references specific player mistakes.
- **Aesthetics (Gemini Image)**: Textures and planetary backdrops are generated by `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, ensuring no two sectors ever look the same.

## 🌍 Google Services Integration

### Google Maps Grounding (Sector Discovery)
To bridge the gap between virtual exploration and real-world science, the game uses **Maps Grounding**. By querying the player's `navigator.geolocation`, the AI identifies real-world observatories, planetariums, and space research centers nearby. This grounds the player's "Cadet" status in reality, encouraging them to visit actual centers of astronomical discovery.

### Google Search Grounding (Live News Feed)
The HUD includes a "Galactic Broadcast" powered by `googleSearch`. It fetches real 2024/2025 space-related news discoveries, ensuring the game lore is constantly updated with humanity's actual progress in space exploration. Destination planets are often named after real exoplanets discovered in the last 12 months.

## 🕹 Roguelite Progression
VOID CADET introduces a "System Upgrade" system. Between warps, players collect **Artifacts**:
- **Warp Charge Boost**: Faster gate synchronization.
- **Extra Life**: Repairs ship integrity (reclaims lost balls).
- **Score Multiplier**: Increases point velocity based on combo strings.
These artifacts are carried over across sectors, allowing for "broken" builds that can survive high-gravity industrial biomes.

## 🛡 Security, Compliance & Performance
- **Billing Security**: High-compute models like Veo require the user to select their own billing project via `window.aistudio.openSelectKey()`, protecting the developer from unmanaged API costs.
- **Resource Efficiency**: 3D geometries (walls, bumpers, balls) are shared in memory to prevent draw-call bloat. Audio decoding is handled via high-efficiency raw PCM processing to minimize latency.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**: 
    - **Aria Live Regions**: Crucial for the AI Tactician's voice-to-text backups.
    - **Semantic HUD**: High-contrast neon borders and clear role definitions (`role="progressbar"`, `role="alert"`) ensure the game is playable for users with different visual needs.

## 🚀 The 2026 Roadmap
- **Persistent Wreckage**: Using Gemini's context window to save player "death locations" as static obstacles for other players in a shared universe.
- **Dynamic Shaders**: Injecting AI-generated GLSL code to change the "glitch" or "neon" effects of the table live.
- **Co-Pilot Mode**: A second player interacting via the Live API to nudge the ball using only their voice.
